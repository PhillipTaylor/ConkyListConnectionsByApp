This is a very simple perl script that writes out the number of open connections
your machine currently has, grouped by application name. It's designed to used
in conky. See screenshot.png for an example. This script generates the "Connections"
part of the screenshot.

TO USE
------

Download the script, make it executable and put {exec /path/to/script } in your
conkyrc.
